# Ashwin's GitHub Page

This repository powers [ashwin-pc.github.io](https://ashwin-pc.github.io).

The landing page fetches profile information and recent projects from the GitHub API, dynamically tinting the theme to match the profile picture.
Sections and project cards sit on a subtle glassmorphic layer with animated reveals. On mobile, content is spaced tighter and the project list becomes a swipeable carousel highlighting the mostâ€‘starred repositories.
